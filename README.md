# ASCIIFPS
Looks like WOLF3D, but can it really run on DOS?
# Compiling and Running
## Deps
Visual Studio 2017 and C/C++ support enabled
## Compiling
Open up the solution, then go to build > build solution
## Running
Press the green button that says "Local Windows Debugger"
# Notes
There are some glitches with movement, you might get stuck so refer to the minimap on the top left corner

Controls are WASD for movement, Q and E for strafing and space bar to shoot fireballs.

Make sure you copy the spr folder to the same directory as the exe! (the spr folder is located at projectdir/ASCIIFPS/spr)
